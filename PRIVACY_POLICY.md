# Privacy Policy for SousChef

**Last updated: January 13, 2026**

## Introduction

SousChef ("we", "our", or "the app") is a baking assistant application that helps you manage and time your recipes. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data Stored Locally

SousChef stores all data locally on your device. This includes:

- **Recipes**: Any recipes you create, edit, or import
- **Recipe images**: Photos you attach to your recipes
- **Timer state**: Current baking session progress and alarm settings

**This data never leaves your device** and is not transmitted to any external servers.

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect personal information
- We do not collect usage analytics
- We do not collect location data
- We do not use tracking technologies
- We do not create user accounts
- We do not store data on external servers

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device in the app's private storage area. This data is:

- Only accessible by the SousChef app
- Deleted when you uninstall the app
- Not backed up to cloud services by the app itself (though your device's backup settings may include app data)

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect or transmit any data from your device.

When you use the "Share" feature to share a recipe, you control where that recipe is sent using your device's standard sharing options.

## Permissions

SousChef may request the following permissions:

- **Notifications**: To alert you when recipe timer steps are complete
- **Alarms**: To set precise timers for your baking steps
- **Photo access**: To allow you to attach images to your recipes (only when you choose to add a photo)

These permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and do not result in any data being collected or transmitted.

## Children's Privacy

SousChef does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

**Email**: [YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS]

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: Your data is on your device
- **Delete**: Uninstall the app or clear app data in your device settings
- **Export**: Use the Share feature to export your recipes
